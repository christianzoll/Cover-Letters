Hello,

	I’m Christian, an IT Specialist who's recently been affected by a layoff with my previous employer. I’ve been a specialist for two years working with software in the React, JavaScript, Node, Typescript and MongoDB environment of libraries and frameworks. I like to imagine that I'm Master Chief when exercising, use football statistics to practice mental math, and practice code to keep my mind sharp. And, I would love to have a conversation about working together. Please feel free to take a look at some of my links and contact me about any more information that could be of use to you. Thank you.

Sincerely, 

Hans Christian Zoll
