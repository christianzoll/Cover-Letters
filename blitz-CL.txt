Hello, I've recently returned home to New Mexico after a layoff with my last employer. JavaScript and it's accompanying technologies are what I've made a career in and I would like to continue that with YOUR COMPANY. I like to use football statistics to practice mental math, belt while strumming a guitar, and practice code to keep my mind nimble. And, I would love to have a conversation about working together. Please feel free to contact me about any more information that could be of use to you.
