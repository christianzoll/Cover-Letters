Hello,

	I’m Christian, a Full-Stack Developer who's recently been affected by a layoff with my previous employer. I’ve been a developer for two years working with primarily the React, JavaScript, Node, HTML, CSS, Typescript and MongoDB environment of libraries and frameworks. I like to use football statistics to practice mental math, wail into a microphone while strumming a guitar, and practice code to keep my brain sharp. And, I would love to have a conversation about working together. Please feel free to take a look at my links and contact me about any more information that could be of use in your consideration.
Thank you.

Sincerely, 

Hans Christian Zoll
